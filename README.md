# Registration Service

The Registration Service is responsible for handling user registations. This service is part of the greater UIMA project. It communicates between an API gateway by desktop clients and has a direct connection to an event bus. This service has its own database for storing user data:

```json

  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },

## Endpoints

The Registration Service has one controller for handling all user registrations.

> âš  All requests must be authenticated to reach the following endpoints

`POST users/register`

This endpoint is responsible for registering basic users. Should validation of data fail or a conflicting display name occur, a 400 reponse is returned along with a message. When a user is registered, hes registration is published to an event bus with routing key `users.new` and his exchange keys, with routing key `users.new.keys`.
